## Overview
<!---
## Who is this for?
The README should be addressed to somebody who's never seen this before.
But also don't assume that they're a novice.
-->
The at_demo_data package is for Flutter developers who would like use [The Virtual Environment (VE)](https://atsign.dev/docs/get-started/the-virtual-environment/) for running demo apps and testing on the atPlatform. The VE provides a full stack private atPlatform environment to build and test applications offline. A number preset atSigns are included in the VE and the secrets and keys are provided in this package for those test atSigns.

<!---
Give some context and state the intent - we welcome contributions - we want
pull requests and to hear about issues. Include the boilerplate language
below to add some context to atPlatform packages 
-->
This open source package is written in Dart, supports Flutter and follows the
atPlatform's decentralized, edge computing model with the following features: 
- Cryptographic control of data access through personal data stores
- No application backend needed
- End to end encryption where only the data owner has the keys
- Private and surveillance free connectivity
 <!--- add package features here -->

We call giving people control of access to their data ‚Äúflipping the internet‚Äù
and you can learn more about how it works by reading this
[overview](https://atsign.com/flip-the-internet/).

<!---
Does this package publish to pub.dev or similar? This README will be the
first thing that developers see there and should be written such that it
lets them quickly assess if it fits their need.
-->
## Get started
There are two options to get started using this package.

<!---
If the package has a template that at_app uses to generate a skeleton app,
that is the quickest way for a developer to assess it and get going with
their app.
-->

<!---
Cloning the repo and example app from GitHub is the next option for a
developer to get started.
-->
### 1. Clone it from GitHub
<!---
Make sure to edit the link below to refer to your package repo.
-->
Feel free to fork a copy of the source from the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/atsign-foundation/at_demos). The example code contained there is the same as the template that is used by at_app above.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
```

<!---
The last option is to use the traditionaL instructions for adding the package to a project which can be found on pub.dev. 
Please be sure to replace the package name in the url below the right one for this package.
-->
### 2. Manually add the package to a project

Instructions on how to manually add this package to you project can be found on pub.dev [here](https://pub.dev/packages/at_demo_data/install).


<!---
Add details on how to use the package in an application
-->

### Usage

<!---
Make sure your source code annotations are clear and comprehensive.
-->
For more information, please see the API documentation listed on pub.dev.

<!---
If we have any pages for these docs on atsign.dev site, it would be 
good to add links.(optional)

#### How to retrieve test environment values
```dart
// Production environment
String prodRoot = at_demo_data.prodRoot;
int prodPort = at_demo_data.prodPort;

// Local environment
String virtualRoot = at_demo_data.virtualRoot;
int virtualPort = at_demo_data.virtualPort;
```

#### How to access sample data:
```dart
// List of all atsigns
List<String> atSigns = at_demo_data.allAtsigns;

// PKAM public key String for a particular atSign can be retrieved from 
// the pkamPublicKeyMap
String pkamPublicKey = at_demo_data.pkamPublicKeyMap['@aliceüõ†'];

// PKAM private key String for a particular atSign can be retrieved from 
// the pkamPrivateKeyMap
String pkamPrivate = at_demo_data.pkamPrivateKeyMap['@aliceüõ†'];

// CRAM key String for a particular atSign can be retrieved from 
// the cramKeyMap
String cramKey = at_demo_data.cramKeyMap['@aliceüõ†'];
```
