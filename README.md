Welcome! We have a collection of demo apps written to help you get a head start on your atPlatform journey. We recommend looking at the apps in the following order:

1. `sshnp_docker_demo`: A demo to establish an SSH connection between two Docker containers without requiring any open ports on the host machine (not even port 22). To begin, follow the steps outlined in the [README](./sshnp_docker_demo/README.md) of sshnp_docker_demo to get started!

2. `at_notifications`: A demo using `.notify` and `.subscribe` to send/receive notifications in the atPlatform. Demo uses [at_client] as the core dependency to utilize the atProtocol and [at_onboarding_cli] to authenticate atSigns to their atServers. To begin, follow the steps outlined in the [README](./at_notifications/README.md) of at_notifications to get started!

3. `sshnp_raspberrypi_demo`: A demo establishing an SSH connection between a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B and a client device without requiring any open ports on the host machine (not even port 22). To begin, follow the steps outlined in the [README](./sshnp_raspberrypi_demo/README.md) of sshnp_raspberrypi_demo to get started!


We are super glad that you are beginning your journey as an atDev. We highly recommend that you join our discord dev community for troubleshooting, dev updates, and much more!
